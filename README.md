## Overview of the School District Analysis

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project is to replace the math and reading scores of the ninth graders at Thomas High School because their grades were altered due to academic dishonesty. After replacing the grades, a school district analysis is performed to see the difference before and after the change of grades.

## Results

- The follwoing two charts show the before and after of changes made to ninth graders' grades from Thomas High School. 


- How is the district summary affected?
  - The district summary does not alter too much: average math score from 79.0% to 78.9%; average reading score did not change; math passing percentage from 75.0% to 74.8%; reading passing percentage from 85.8% to 85.7%; and overall passing percentage from 65.2% to 64.9%. 
  
- How is the school summary affected?
  - According to the district summary before the change, Thomas High School's math passing percentage is 66.911315%. After the percentage of passing of the ninth graders from Thomas High School was changed, the percentage raised to 93.185690%, by 26.274375%. The reading passing percentage and overall passing percentage are also raised: reading percentage from 69.663609% to 97.018739%, by 27.35513%, and overall percentage from 65.076453% to 90.630324%, by 25.553871%. 
  
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  - Thomas High School was not in the top 5th schools ranked by overall passing percentage before the change, however after the change Thomas High School ranks second place, with a 90.630324% overall passing percentage.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade: In terms of math scores, before the change, 9th grade had the highest score in Thomas High, with a score of 83.5900. The scores for 9th grade is cancelled to NaN after the change, so 11th grade became the grade with the highest score, with a score of 83.498795. In terms of reading scores, 9th grade did not have the highest score to begin with; both before and after the change 10th grade has the highest score (84.254157). 
  - Scores by school spending: Since Thomas High School costs $638 per student, it falls in the range between $630 and $644. All the passing percentages increased: math from 71.274736% to 75.653798%; reading from 81.499026% to 86.058214%; and overall passing percentage from 61.800133% to 66.059112%. 
  - Scores by school size: Thomas High School has 1635 students, thus it falls in the category of medium (between 1000 and 2000). Every percentage increased, without affecting the average scores: math percentage went up from 88.327523% to 93.582398%; reading percentage went from 91.261628% to 96.732654%; and overall passing percentge went from 85.447223% to 90.557997. 
  - Scores by school type: Thomas High School is a charter school, thus it makes sense charter school's scores were affected. The only scores affected are the percentages; the average scores stay the same. Math percentage went from 90% to 94%; reading percentage went from 93% to 97%; and overall passing percentage went from 87% to 90%.

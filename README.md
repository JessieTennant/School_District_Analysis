## Overview of the School District Analysis

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project is to replace the math and reading scores of the ninth graders at Thomas High School because their grades were altered due to academic dishonesty. After replacing the grades, a school district analysis is performed to see the difference before and after the change of grades.

## Results

  - The district summary does not alter too much: average math score from 79.0% to 78.9%; average reading score did not change; math passing percentage from 75.0% to 74.8%; reading passing percentage from 85.8% to 85.7%; and overall passing percentage from 65.2% to 64.9%. 
  
- How is the school summary affected?
  - According to the district summary before the change, Thomas High School's math passing percentage is 66.911315%.
